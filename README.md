Extension to make using THNK simpler and easier

# Installation

[THNK Framework](https://thnk.cloud/) can be installed from [here.](https://github.com/arthuro555/THNK) 
You're going to need to install 'THNK.json' since it's the main extension and also some adapter (for example P2P).
After you've downloaded the the THNK extensions you need, go to [Gdevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) then head over to extensions (inside of an project)
and on the bottom left there's button to 'import extension' click that and add the 'THNK.json' and also some adapter.
